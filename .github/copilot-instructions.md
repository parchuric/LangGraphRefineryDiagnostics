This is an Angular project. We will be building a user interface to interact with an Apache AGE graph database.

Key features to implement:
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for graph nodes and relationships.
- Graph visualization.
- Search functionality for the graph data.

Libraries to be used:
- Angular Material for UI components.
- vis-network for graph visualization (or a similar library if a better alternative is found).

Backend Interaction:
- For now, Angular services will mock backend responses.
- Later, these services will be updated to communicate with a real backend API that interacts with the Apache AGE database.
